# TempVCBot

A modern and flexible Discord bot that empowers users to create and manage their own **temporary voice channels** on demand.

---

## About The Project

Tired of a cluttered voice channel list?

**TempVCBot** solves this by allowing server members to instantly create private, temporary voice channels whenever they need them. Once everyone leaves, the channel is **automatically deleted**, keeping your server clean and organized.

This bot offers two convenient ways for users to get a channel:

* A simple `/createvc` slash command
* Joining a dedicated `âž• Create VC` voice channel

The channel creator gets full control via **DM-based menus** and **slash commands** to manage privacy, user limits, invites, and more.

---

## Key Features

* **ðŸŽ™ On-Demand Channel Creation**
  Users can create a VC instantly using either a slash command or by joining a special "Create VC" channel.

* **ðŸ”§ Full User Control**
  The channel creator can:

  * ðŸ”’ Set the channel to Public or Private
  * âž• Invite specific members to a private channel
  * ðŸ‘¢ Kick members from the channel
  * ðŸ”¢ Set a custom user limit

* **Automatic Cleanup**
  Channels are deleted automatically when the last user leaves.

* ** Admin Setup**
  A one-time `/setup` command handles everything: it creates the needed category and permissions for you.

* **Interface**
  Built with `discord.py` using slash commands and ephemeral messages for a clean, user-friendly experience.
